hellow alice. i know it is cold where you are on the edge. This is all understandable- being this close to a black hole. 
We got you though. I've sent you a space jacket. it is floating next to you. it is green, not my choice, but perhaps will remind you of your home. ok. signing off. we all care about you alice.      
alice, are you still in the black hole? or on the edge of the black hole?
